"""

Generic MITM solver for finding two-list merging-based MITM attacks.
It uses the SCIP solver and its python interface pyscipopt.

See "generic4.py" for an implementation of a 4-list strategy. We did not
implement larger strategies.

The main function defined below works for the three settings defined in the paper:
- Present-like setting (the basic setting)
- AES-like setting (matching through MixColumns enabled)
- Extended setting (XOR and branching cells enabled)

The computation model is either classical, or quantum (QRAQM); see the paper. It
finds either one or all the solutions of the specified path.
The basic constraints are wrapping constraints. IO constraints are also
available (e.g., in the Present / Spongent examples), but in a somewhat restricted
manner.

The most technical part of the implementation is the definition of "global
reduction" variables for each cell in the AES-like setting, which can be found
around line 400 of this file. This implementation differs from the view of 
"global edges" with which we started in the paper. In the Present-like case
it simply aggregates for each cell the total amount of "global edges" that this
cell belongs to, and in the AES-like case it includes the reduction through MC.

    Finds the best complexity of a 2-list merging MITM attack as specified in the
    paper. Arguments:
    
    - time_target -- set only if we want to reach a particular time complexity
    - computation_model -- either CLASSICAL_COMPUTATION or QUANTUM_COMPUTATION (QRAQM)
    - optimize_with_mem -- True if we include the memory in optimization goal
    - setting -- one of the 3 flags AES_SETTING, PRESENT_SETTING, EXTENDED_SETTING
    - flag -- either SINGLE_SOLUTION or ALL_SOLUTIONS

    The combination of ALL_SOLUTIONS and QUANTUM_COMPUTATION will yield an error (in the
    quantum setting, we study single-solution cases).

    - cut_forward -- rounds at which the forward list has no cells. If not specified,
      it will be searched.
    - cut_backward -- same for backward list. If not specified, it will be searched as well.
    - covered_round -- a round that will be colored. If not specified, it will also be searched.
    - forward_hint, backward_hint, forward_zero, backward_zero: set manually the coloring
            of some cells. This can greatly help reduce the solving time if we have an
            idea of what the path should look like.

    Returns a dictionary of cell colorings, and of global linear constraints.
    Note that these global constraints are actually recomputed from the internal
    "global_reduction" variables attached to each cell, and in the AES case, they
    do not include reduction through MC.
